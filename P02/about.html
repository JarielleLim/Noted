				<p class="about-flex-text"> Here at Noted, we know that finding a balance between beauty and usability is always a struggle, especially when it comes to sketchbooks that artists find in their typical hobby craft stores. How often have you seen a beautifully bound notebook only to find that the paper inside is made of terrible material, or is ruled when all you want is a blank one? Noted sells blank and dotted notebooks, offering a large selection of different papers, qualities and materials as well as covers that allow you to customize your notebook, your way.</p>
