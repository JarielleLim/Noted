			<h2>Company purpose</h2>

			<div>
				<h3>The Company's Goal</h3>
				<p> Finding a balance between beauty and usability is always a struggle, especially when it comes to sketchbooks that artists find in their typical hobby craft stores. How often have you seen a beautifully bound notebook only to find that the paper inside is made of terrible material, or is ruled when all you want is a blank one? Noted sells blank and dotted notebooks, offering a large selection of different papers, qualities and materials as well as covers that allow you to customize your notebook, your way.</p>

				<h3>Company Potential Customers</h3>
				<p>The target market for this online store are mainly students and young adults who are in the illustration, art, and design field. These are for people who want a little variety from the typical blank moleskin journals or from sketchbooks that only have the standard sketchbook covers of a sketched apple. This can also be marketed to people who just enjoy journaling on blank paper and who find the ruled pages constricting.</p>

				<p>Persona: Abby is a 21 year old fashion designer who loves to doodle on the train, at coffee shops, and generally anywhere that gives her inspiration. However, as much as she likes the quality of her canson sketchbook, she also does not want to always be carrying around a conspicious sketchbook. This is especially true when she does her afternoon people watching and wants to sketch inspirational street fashion from the people around her. Canvase allows her to get the quality of paper she wants, with a less intrusive sketchbook that can fit the most formal of occassions.</p>

				<h3>Why Buy?</h3>
				<p>This company caters to a smaller market but also one that is lacking in resources. Many people would love to have well-made sketchbooks/notebooks but may not have the crafting ability to make their own. It is also hard to come by sketchbooks/notebooks that have blank paper</p>
